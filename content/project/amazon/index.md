# Amazon Fashion Recommender

Used Amazon Product Advertising API to gather data locally and used those files for Recommendation

# Used Two Approaches

1. [Natural Language Processing on Product Description](https://github.com/karthikraja95/AmazonFashionRecommender/blob/master/AmazonFashion.ipynb)
2. [Convolutional Neural Network on Product Images](https://github.com/karthikraja95/AmazonFashionRecommender/blob/master/image_similarity_cnn.ipynb)

Look at the Notebooks for more details
