I am a Data Scientist at [CIBC](https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc.html) and previously I was working as a Researcher at [WangLab](https://wanglab.ml/) affiliated with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and [University Health Network](https://www.uhn.ca/), proudly advised by Prof. [Bo Wang](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/bo-wang/). I completed my Master's degree in ECE, specialized in Machine Learning at the [University of Toronto](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) advised by Prof. [Deepa Kundur](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/kundur-d/) and by Prof. [Yuri Lawryshyn](https://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/people/lawryshyn-yuri-a/). My current research focuses on at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing** and **Healthcare**. Apart from my research, I am also interested in **Deep Learning** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning** with the focus of transfer learning, imitation learning, model-based RL. **My ultimate goal is to build robust, privacy-preserved, and interpretable algorithms with human like ability to generalize in real-world environments by using data as its own supervision.**

Throughout my life, I have approached every challenge with enthusiasm, creativity, and a ceaseless desire to achieve success. This passion and drive have paved the way to countless opportunities, unique experiences, and excellent relationships, both personally and professionally. I enjoy working with people and discussing ideas. If you would like to chat, feel free to send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kbhaskar_95).

Outside of academics, I enjoy basketball, hiking, biking, running  (pretty much every sport !).
