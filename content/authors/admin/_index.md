# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am currently working as a Student Researcher at [WangLab](https://wanglab.ml/) affiliated with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and [University Health Network](https://www.uhn.ca/), proudly advised by Prof. [Bo Wang](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/bo-wang/). I completed my Master's degree in ECE, specialized in Machine Learning at the [University of Toronto](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) advised by Prof. [Deepa Kundur](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/kundur-d/) and by Prof. [Yuri Lawryshyn](https://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/people/lawryshyn-yuri-a/). My current research focuses on at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing** and **Healthcare**. Apart from my research, I am also interested in **Deep Learning** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning** with the focus of transfer learning, imitation learning, model-based RL. **My ultimate goal is to build robust, privacy-preserved, and interpretable algorithms with human like ability to generalize in real-world environments by using data as its own supervision.**
