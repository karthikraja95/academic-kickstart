Few-Shot Incremental Learning (FSIL)

What is Few Shot Learning?

The human visual system exhibits the remarkable ability to effortlessly learn novel concepts from only one or a few examples and reliably recognize them later on. I think the human visual system is so efficient when learning novel concepts because it exploits its past experiences about the (visual) world. For example: As humans, we have an excellent representation of the world; we only need a few samples to identify a car or a building. Mimicking this behaviour on an Artificial Intelligence system is called Few-Shot Learning. This research area is exciting and challenging with many practical, real-world applications, including real-time vision interactive applications.

What is Incremental Learning?

Incremental Learning refers to a family of scalable algorithms that learn to sequentially update models from infinite data streams. Whereas in “traditional” machine learning, we’re given a complete dataset consisting of (input, output) pairs, in Incremental Learning, we don’t have all of the data available when creating the model. Instead, the data points arrive one at a time, and we have to build a “living” model, one that learns and adapts as the data comes.
