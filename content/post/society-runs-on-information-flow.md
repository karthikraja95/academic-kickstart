# Society Runs on Information Flows


## What is Privacy?

Privacy is fundamental to our lives, yet for the past three decades since the rise of the internet, each individual has lost a large chunk of their private information to companies as well as political entities.

For instance, social media platforms collect and analyze large amounts of user data or sell them to other companies. Some governments collect data via mass surveillance programs to monitor their citizens. News networks are increasingly known to offer biased opinions and misinformation to their audience based on information about their target audience’s political beliefs and social values, thus polarizing society to the two extremes on the spectrum.

But despite hearing so much news and debates about privacy, how do we actually define this concept? What does information flow have to do with privacy? How should we respond to social media platforms and other service providers that violate our private data? Should private data be kept absolute private? Or can we utilize some form of technology to safely share data for social good? What are some serious problems caused by bad information flows and violation of privacy? How do some societies and communities solve these challenges?

These are some of the questions that this post tries to discuss.
