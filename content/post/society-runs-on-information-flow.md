# Private AI - "Society Runs on Information Flows"

The main topic of the article is the **privacy-transparency trade-off** and how it affects a huge number of issues. This article walks through some of the most important challenges to society and *identifies how the privacy-transparency trade-off underpins them*. Improving information flows, by solving this trade-off, can help us in many areas like disinformation, scientific innovation, and even democracy itself.

> Every part of the human experience is soaked in information flows. Since the beginning of human collaboration.

We share our medical information with our doctor. We share our location with an app to get directions. We share our heart rates and sleeping patterns in hopes of improving our well-being. Every day, we share personal information to exchange goods, receive services, and in general, to collaborate. Sharing information is a part of almost every aspect of our life.

## Information Flow

What is an information flow? Let's take the simple example of email. A sender, a message, a receiver. Probably one of the most straight-forward information flows. But even email is much more nuanced than just the three attributes sender, message, receiver:

- Should other people than the receiver be allowed to read it?
- Would I be comfortable with the receiver forwarding my email?
- The email provider could probably read it, do I trust them to not do so?
- Do I want the email provider to read my mail only for a specific purpose, like for spam detection, but not for targeted advertising?
- Am I sending my exact identity with the email? Anonymously? Or a mix: as a member of group?
- Do I know exactly who the recipient is? When I'm sending the mail to a doctor's office, who reads it?
- Can the receiver have confidence in the identity of the sender, whaf if my account was hacked?

Questions like these exist around every information flow!

Newly emerging communication channels: **Snapchat** deletes the messages once they've been read and prohibits forwarding or screenshotting. **WhatsApp** or **Signal** use end-to-end encryption for messages so it's impossible for anyone other than the intended recipient to read them. *Users switch to these services because of seemingly tiny changes to the guarantees around information flow.* I feel like, this is the beginning of a new revolution!!!

> An information flow is a flow of bits from a sender to a receiver. The sender and receiver could either be an exact individual, a member of a group, or an anonymous individual. The identity of the sender, the receiver, and the content of the message itself can be probabilistic.

## What is Privacy??

*Privacy is not about secrecy*. People feel that their privacy is violated if information flows in a way they didn't expect. It's all about the **appropriate flow of information, not about the information itself.**

>  Privacy means the ability to ensure information flows that are according to social norms

Example: Google Street View: why are people having trouble with Google taking photos of them in their front yard, when anybody could come by and see them exactly there? Because *when public information becomes so much more public, it bothers us*.

> [Contextual Integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity): sharing the same information might be private in one context, but not in another context. It’s about achieving appropriate information flow.

Example: My face is considered public information as soon as I leave the house, because anybody can see it. So why is facial recognition software so troubling? Not only because it could be misused (i.e., for mass surveillance), but because it is identification without my consent. The information flow is not triggered by me, but by whatever system is watching me.
