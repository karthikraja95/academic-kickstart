# Private AI - "Society Runs on Information Flows"

The main topic of the article is the **privacy-transparency trade-off** and how it affects a huge number of issues. This article walks through some of the most important challenges to society and *identifies how the privacy-transparency trade-off underpins them*. Improving information flows, by solving this trade-off, can help us in many areas like disinformation, scientific innovation, and even democracy itself.

> Every part of the human experience is soaked in information flows. Since the beginning of human collaboration.

We share our medical information with our doctor. We share our location with an app to get directions. We share our heart rates and sleeping patterns in hopes of improving our well-being. Every day, we share personal information to exchange goods, receive services, and in general, to collaborate. Sharing information is a part of almost every aspect of our life.

## Information Flow

What is an information flow? Let's take the simple example of email. A sender, a message, a receiver. Probably one of the most straight-forward information flows. But even email is much more nuanced than just the three attributes sender, message, receiver:

- Should other people than the receiver be allowed to read it?
- Would I be comfortable with the receiver forwarding my email?
- The email provider could probably read it, do I trust them to not do so?
- Do I want the email provider to read my mail only for a specific purpose, like for spam detection, but not for targeted advertising?
- Am I sending my exact identity with the email? Anonymously? Or a mix: as a member of group?
- Do I know exactly who the recipient is? When I'm sending the mail to a doctor's office, who reads it?
- Can the receiver have confidence in the identity of the sender, whaf if my account was hacked?

Questions like these exist around every information flow!

Newly emerging communication channels: **Snapchat** deletes the messages once they've been read and prohibits forwarding or screenshotting. **WhatsApp** or **Signal** use end-to-end encryption for messages so it's impossible for anyone other than the intended recipient to read them. *Users switch to these services because of seemingly tiny changes to the guarantees around information flow.* I feel like, this is the beginning of a new revolution!!!

> An information flow is a flow of bits from a sender to a receiver. The sender and receiver could either be an exact individual, a member of a group, or an anonymous individual. The identity of the sender, the receiver, and the content of the message itself can be probabilistic.

## What is Privacy??

*Privacy is not about secrecy*. People feel that their privacy is violated if information flows in a way they didn't expect. It's all about the **appropriate flow of information, not about the information itself.**

>  Privacy means the ability to ensure information flows that are according to social norms

Example: Google Street View: why are people having trouble with Google taking photos of them in their front yard, when anybody could come by and see them exactly there? Because *when public information becomes so much more public, it bothers us*.

> [Contextual Integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity): sharing the same information might be private in one context, but not in another context. It’s about achieving appropriate information flow.

Example: My face is considered public information as soon as I leave the house, because anybody can see it. So why is facial recognition software so troubling? Not only because it could be misused (i.e., for mass surveillance), but because it is identification without my consent. The information flow is not triggered by me, but by whatever system is watching me.

## Analogy: Data is Fire

There are several analogies for Data like [Data is the New Oil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/11/15/data-is-the-new-oil-and-thats-a-good-thing/?sh=6b1e35e37304). A better analgoy would be [Data is Fire](https://ystrickler.medium.com/data-is-fire-92a110557ef8).

- Data can be duplicated (Infinite timess!!!)
- Data can help us prosper and solve problems
- Data can cause irreparable damage if misused

Data is like a double edge sword, its true for all kinds of data, not just senstive data like **healthcare data or financial data**.

>  When I bring a topic like Privacy with my friends, they usually say *I don't have anything to hide, so why would I care about Privacy*. But, in my opinion that's not true - **Everything is a Private Data**.

## Every Data is a Private Data

Your grocery shopping list is boring, right? Not always. *You might not care now whether somebody knows you're buying bread.* But when you suddenly stop buying bread (and other carbs), it might be an indication of the diagnosis of diabetes. *Suddenly it's very private information that you might not want to share.*

Well you can say, we can **annonymize the data**. Anonymization seems like the obvious solution to protect the identities of people in data, this does not work reliably in real-world data. *Thanks to the power of Machine Learning, even when names are removed from data, other features can be used to identify you.*

And even when your exact identity is not recoverable, data can be used for **targeting**: As long as someone is able to reach you (via your browser, your email, your neighborhood, your university, etc ...), **your name is not at all necessary to do harm.**

> **Annonymization** does not **WORK**

Example: Anonymization works so badly, that the attackers can systematically exploit its weaknesses and make it as a business model. For example, couple of years ago Guardian post published an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/10/medical-data-multibillion-dollar-business-report-warns) on **Your Private Medical Data is for Sale**. Several US company that buys anonymized health data and distributes **"market insights"** from it to insurance companies. They can then, for example, avoid selling insurance to high-risk communities like poor neighborhoods, where people are more likely to get sick.

Also, read this article on [Strava](https://medium.com/strava-engineering/the-global-heatmap-now-6x-hotter-23fc01d301de) releasing an anonymized heatmap of network of athletes activities that revealed the location of US military bases. So, *privacy can be relevant not only on an individual level but on an organizational or even national security level.*

## Privacy and Transparency Dilemmas

Due to the potentially harmful use of data, we have to constantly make trade-offs and decide whether to share information, weighing the benefits and the risks.

> A privacy dilemma is a trade-off whether or not to reveal information, where revealing that information causes some social good (like advances in medical research) but could also lead to harm (like the misuse of medical data).

Privacy dilemmas have various costs. The most obvious is a privacy violation where data is shared in good faith but the information is misused. On the other hand, there are societal costs when information instead is kept secret: a failure to accomplish important outcomes of information flow (scientific progress, meaningful relationships, accountability).

> A transparency dilemma is when someone is forced to make a decision without having access to the information they need to make it.

Sometimes the necessary information flows don't exist at all (trusting a stranger to fix your tire), sometimes they exist but their content is not verified (online reviews).

Stopping all information flow and locking all data is not the solution to the privacy issue. This would prevent good use of data (think medical care, climate research) and also make undesirable behaviour easier (money laundering, lack of accountability). Maximizing privacy could lead to a lack of transparency!
